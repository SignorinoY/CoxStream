\title{Simulated Stream Survival Data}
\format{
A data frame with 1500 rows and 10 variables:
\describe{
\item{batch_id}{The index of the batch, ranging from 1 to 10.}
\item{record_id}{The index of the observation, ranging from 1 to 1500.}
\item{patient_id}{The index of the patient, ranging from 1 to 1000.}
\item{time}{The survival time.}
\item{status}{The event status, 0=censored, 1=event.}
\item{X1}{Covariate 1.}
\item{X2}{Covariate 2.}
\item{X3}{Covariate 3.}
\item{X4}{Covariate 4.}
\item{X5}{Covariate 5.}

\description{
The dataset containing simulated survival data for 1000 patients arriving in
10 batches. Each patient may have multiple observations across batches, with
the total number of observations 1500. Covariates of dimension \eqn{5} are
drawn from a multivariate normal distribution with mean zero and covariance
matrix \eqn{\Sigma}, where \eqn{\Sigma_{ij} = \rho^{|i-j|}}
(\eqn{\rho = 0.3}). The hazard function depends on covariates through
\eqn{\bfbeta = (1, \ldots, 1)^{\top}}, with a baseline hazard function
\eqn{\lambda_{0}(t) = t}. The maximum follow-up time is fixed at 3.
